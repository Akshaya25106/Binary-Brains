#Acoustic Echo Cancellation Using NLMS Adaptive Algorithm (MATLAB)
1.Install MATLAB on the computer.
2.Launch the MATLAB application.
3.Create a new script file in the MATLAB Editor.
4.Paste the complete MATLAB program for the NLMS echo cancellation system.
5.Save the script with a .m file extension (for example, nlms_aec.m).
6.Make sure the audio files (far_end.wav and near_end.wav) are stored in the same working folder.
7.Set this folder as the current directory in MATLAB.
8.Run the script using the Run button or by typing the file name in the Command Window.
9.Execute the program to start the echo cancellation process.
10.Observe the results displayed:
   -Microphone signal containing both speech and echo
   -Echo estimated by the NLMS filter
   -Output signal after echo removal
   -ERLE graph showing the reduction of echo over time.

#Audio Source Seperation using STFT
1.Install Python (version 3 or higher) on the computer.
2.Launch VS Code / Notepad / any Python editor.
3.Paste the complete source code into a new file.
4.Save the file with a valid name and .py extension.
5.Keep the mixed audio file mixture.wav in the same directory.
6.Open Command Prompt / Terminal.
7.Change the directory to the location of the saved Python file.
8.Execute the program by typing the run command and pressing Enter.
9.Wait while the audio signal is analyzed and processed.
10.Observe the results:
    Console messages showing processing stages
    Spectrogram of the input audio signal
    Spectrogram of the separated voice signal
    Spectrogram of the separated flute signal
    Output audio files saved in the project folder.
